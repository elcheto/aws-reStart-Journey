# Lab – Introduction to Amazon EC2

In this lab, I explored the fundamentals of **Amazon EC2** by deploying and managing a cloud-based virtual server.

### Project Overview
I launched an EC2 instance using **Amazon Linux 2023** and configured it as a simple web server using a **User Data script** that automatically installed and started the Apache web server. Once the instance was running, I monitored its health and performance through the EC2 dashboard and Amazon CloudWatch.

I then updated the **security group inbound rules** to allow HTTP traffic on port 80 and successfully accessed the web page hosted on the instance using its public IPv4 address.

To practice cloud scalability, I resized the instance from `t3.micro` to `t3.small` and expanded the **Amazon EBS** storage volume from 8 GiB to 10 GiB. 

Finally, I tested **termination protection**, confirmed that it prevented accidental deletion, then disabled it and terminated the instance.
